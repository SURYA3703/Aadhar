Firebase is a Google product which provides backend services, SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords,
phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

You may authenticate users of your app either by using Firebase UI which provides a complete user interface for sign in and authentication or you can integrateFirebase SDK manually into your app.
