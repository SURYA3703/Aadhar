Hey guys!  In this tutorial, I am covering user verification by phone number by sending OTP to the mobile using Firebase authentication.
You can use Firebase Authentication to enable a user to sign in to your app by sending an SMS to userâ€™s device which contains a one-time-password. 
The user then enters this OTP in your app, if the OTP matches then sign in is successful and the user can then access your app.
